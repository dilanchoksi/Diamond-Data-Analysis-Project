# Diamond Value Analysis

## Introduction

Welcome to the Diamond Value Analysis project! In this project, I delve into the fascinating world of diamonds, exploring the factors that influence their value. Diamonds have captivated human fascination for centuries, not just for their physical properties but also for their economic and cultural significance. This project aims to unravel some of the mysteries behind diamond valuation using data science techniques.

## Objective

The primary goal of this project is to analyze a dataset containing various attributes of diamonds, including numerical features such as carat, dimensions, and price, as well as non-numerical features like cut, color, and clarity. By leveraging exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical analysis, and machine learning, we aim to understand the relationships between these attributes and determine their impact on diamond pricing.

I strived to answer two questions:

1) is there a correlation between a diamond's dimensions and price?

2) how dependent is the price of a diamond on non-numerical features, such as cut, color, and clarity?

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and includes comprehensive information about diamonds. It comprises numerical attributes such as carat (weight), dimensions (x, y, z), table (width), and price, along with categorical attributes like cut, color, and clarity. This rich dataset provides us with ample opportunities to explore the intricacies of diamond valuation.
